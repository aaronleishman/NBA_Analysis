# NBA_Analysis
NBA game analysis from Oct 2003 to June 2019

This data comes from kaggle.com and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games). This dataset is for all NBA regular & post season games from the October 2003 to June 2019.

This analysis is done in Python using Pandas and Matplotlib in the Jupyter Notebooks

To due to size limits in  Github I can't upload the data. But you can download it from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games)

Files:
1. Clean_Df.py - Is a python script that I wrote to filter the data and add a column "Year-Month' and then saves the data-frame by saving it to a pickled file.
2. .ipynb files contain my data analysis.
